<h1 align="center">Bot Framework: Build an AI Security Assistant with ease</h1>


## Project Overview

This project explores the newest Bot Framework v4 and provides all the required steps to create a Security Assistant with Azure Bot Service. The Bot has the ability to execute KQL Queries and show the results, generate new ones, and get Security advice from Azure OpenAI, all this within the Teams App.

## Introduction

Before we start with the Bot Framework SDK, we need to prepare our development environment. This section will guide you through the necessary stepsto set up your “canvas” and get started with building your AI-powered writing assistant.

## Prerequisites

To make the most of this solution, here are the prerequisites:

- **Azure Subscription**: Ensure you have an Azure subscription with Open AI enabled. Apply via Microsoft Form for Azure Open AI access.

- **Visual Studio**:  Ensure you have Visual Studio installed with the .NET desktop development workload. You can download it from the official Microsoft website. 

- **Bot Framework Emulator**: This tool allows you to test your bot locally before deploying it to Azure. Download it from the Bot Framework website.

## Getting Started

1. **Install the Bot Framework SDK**: Complete the application to access Azure Open AI services.

2. **Install the required NuGet Packages**: Ensure your workstation is equipped with Docker, Azure Functions Core Tools, Python, and Node.js.

3. **Clone the Repository**: Get started by cloning this repository to your local environment.
